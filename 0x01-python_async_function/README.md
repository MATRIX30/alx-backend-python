## Resources

### Read or watch:

- [Async IO in Python: A Complete Walkthrough](https://realpython.com/async-io-python/)
- [asyncio - Asynchronous I/O](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)
- [random.uniform](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html#random.uniform)

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- `async` and `await` syntax
- How to execute an async program with `asyncio`
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create `asyncio` tasks
- How to use the `random `module

## Requirements

### General

- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7)
- All your files should end with a new line
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.x)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your functions should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
